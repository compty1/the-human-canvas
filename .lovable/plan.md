# LeCompte Portfolio - The Human Experience

## Vision
A bold, pop art-powered portfolio that captures your multidisciplinary creative work exploring the human experience. The design will feature halftone dots, comic book panels, vibrant clashing colors (magenta, cyan, electric yellow, black), bold hand-drawn-style typography, and dynamic panel layouts that mirror your distinctive artistic voice. This won't look like any generic template—it will feel like walking into a gallery of your mind.
